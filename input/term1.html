Even at about 8 months she was really good at lifting the flaps herself and now at 10 months she is starting to associate the body parts in the book with her body parts.  We always touch her foot, hand, etc when we find that part in the book.  The other day she lifted her own shirt to find her belly button which was cute but also shows us that she is learning.

Eventually between 7-9 months, after reading the reviews here, I ordered this. And voila! He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.

When asked where is Dada etc, he would look in the direction of the person or item long before "they", meaning the experts, said he should. He is now 13 months old and still loves the book. Ever since he could walk and multitask, it surprised us that he would take this book up and walk to either his Dad or me so we could read it to him. Needless to say, it's pretty worn at this stage. If there is a less than positive remark I can make is that, although it's a board book, my little guy found a way to rip most of the flaps off. There is tape on every page :-) Not so sure if they could make it any sturdier though. Love this book!!! Definitely get it for your little one.

I point out the bear, ball, and wagon and I say "but where's baby, where could he be?" Then I lift the flap to reveal the baby, my daughter squeals, claps and smiles big and then thoughtfully looks back over at the bear, ball and wagon and then back at the revealed baby.

We have a number of the Karen Katz lift-the-flap books, but this one still seems to engage her the most. The flaps in this book in particular are easy for her to find and lift, and I think she enjoys looking at all the baby faces on each page.The book itself is sturdy, but be aware when leaving them alone with it - our daughter tore one of the flaps out and likes to try to eat the flaps as well. That said, she's been playing around with this book for over a month now, and so far we've only lost one flap, so not too bad!

Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she's just now really starting to get into it and loves it. (Age is almost 2 years old) It's so cute. The size is perfect for setting on her lap while reading. It has various pages of different lift up or lift down, things to do. Where is baby's hands, where is baby's belly button, where is baby's feet, etc. Is also a great learning tool for those just now learning about where not only there own body parts are but as well as others. You can read aloud and ask where is baby's hands? And she lifts the fold to discover where baby's hands are. Colors are bright and vibrant. Book is sturdy and hard back as well as the pages. Easily wipeable which is a plus cause when my daughter gets into pens or markers she likes to stray away from her coloring paper to the closest thing bedside her and if this book is there then it's victim of her coloring, spilling liquids or transfer of food from her hands. Easy to read pages. Easy to lift tabs and are big enough for little fingers. Very durable book. Has been dropped, throw and sat on multiple times and doesn't even have 1 endention. Am considering buying some of the other books that go along with this one. Shipping was fast. Product was as seller described. Packaging was as expected.

The color choices on each page is like a work of art. Of all the books this has been the most beautiful to look at, and both I and my son have enjoyed this book for two months now. So why four stars? The flaps are very, very thin. For this kind of a book the construction is of very poor quality and of all the lift-the-flap books my son has, this has been the most poorly made and deserves only one star. However, because I like the images of this book I still give it four stars. But one of the flaps is long gone. I purchased this together with "Dear Zoo" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. "Dear Zoo" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper. But "Where Is Baby's Belly Button" uses thin paper for the flaps. I hope the publishers correct this design flaw. If yes, then I'll very happily purchase it again for future baby #2 :) [This:O, book:O, is:O, just:O, very:O, beautiful:O, ,:O, cute:O, ,:O, smart:O, ,:O, and:O, overall:O, just:O, adorable:O, .:O, The:O, color:O, choices:O, on:O, each:O, page:O, is:O, like:O, a:O, work:O, of:O, art:O, .:O, Of:O, all:O, the:O, books:O, this:O, has:O, been:O, the:O, most:O, beautiful:O, to:O, look:O, at:O, ,:O, and:O, both:O, I:O, and:O, my:O, son:O, have:O, enjoyed:O, this:O, book:O, for:O, two:DURATION, months:DURATION, now:DATE, .:O, So:O, why:O, four:NUMBER, stars:O, ?:O, The:O, flaps:O, are:O, very:O, ,:O, very:O, thin:O, .:O, For:O, this:O, kind:O, of:O, a:O, book:O, the:O, construction:O, is:O, of:O, very:O, poor:O, quality:O, and:O, of:O, all:O, the:O, lift-the-flap:O, books:O, my:O, son:O, has:O, ,:O, this:O, has:O, been:O, the:O, most:O, poorly:O, made:O, and:O, deserves:O, only:O, one:NUMBER, star:O, .:O, However:O, ,:O, because:O, I:O, like:O, the:O, images:O, of:O, this:O, book:O, I:O, still:O, give:O, it:O, four:NUMBER, stars:O, .:O, But:O, one:NUMBER, of:O, the:O, flaps:O, is:O, long:O, gone:O, .:O, I:O, purchased:O, this:O, together:O, with:O, ``:O, Dear:O, Zoo:O, '':O, and:O, in:O, comparison:O, between:O, the:O, two:NUMBER, books:O, is:O, like:O, night:TIME, and:O, day:DURATION, .:O, ``:O, Dear:O, Zoo:O, '':O, has:O, held:O, up:O, very:O, nicely:O, -LRB-:O, also:O, much:O, beloved:O, by:O, my:O, son:O, -RRB-:O, because:O, the:O, flaps:O, are:O, made:O, of:O, carton-like:O, paper:O, .:O, But:O, ``:O, Where:O, Is:O, Baby:O, 's:O, Belly:O, Button:O, '':O, uses:O, thin:O, paper:O, for:O, the:O, flaps:O, .:O, I:O, hope:O, the:O, publishers:O, correct:O, this:O, design:O, flaw:O, .:O, If:O, yes:O, ,:O, then:O, I:O, 'll:O, very:O, happily:O, purchase:O, it:O, again:O, for:O, future:DATE, baby:O, #:MONEY, 2:MONEY, ::O, -RRB-:O] </div></a></br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TUW9VPWRZ418/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604"> <div style="color:LightGreen;">This is a great book for many ages!

They are the perfect book for babies! They are sturdy enough to withstand baby teeth and drool. The pictures are always bright and captivating, they definitely keep little one's attention. Out of all the Lift-the-Flap books my daughter has, her favorite might be Where is Baby's Belly Button? Every time it gets to the part to "life the flap" my daughter squeals in delight or starts trying to talk! The only thing I'd suggest is to watch out for little hands trying to rip the "flap" off. The pages are thick and nearly impossible to tear, but the "flap" can be torn off by a determined Little One. However, it's nothing a little double-sided tape can't fix.

He smiles at the bright pictures and always raises his eyebrows as if surprised and impressed by the lift up flaps that reveal more bright pictures. Thie simplicity of the pictures, using common shapes and colors of the same value, are just right for infants. This is a great book for small babies.

I also, obviously like that it is a lift the flap book, because they engage my son for so long. One of the reasons I chose this particular book is because it addresses body parts and I thought it would be helpful when learning those body parts.What I don't like:Quality, quality, quality! We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book. It has not been a hit for us and is a bit disappointing. I would have given it 4 stars (maybe 5) if the quality was better.
